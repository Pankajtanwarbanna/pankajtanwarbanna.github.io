                I had a best friend👬 . We used to study together, party together and talk together. But one day, he moved to Surat for his job. I was alone😰, couldn't study with anybody, no parties, and no one to talk with as I only had one friend. ☹️
                <br><br>
                Then, I decided to make three new friends, one who could help me study 📒, one who loved to party🕺 and one who liked to sit around and talk 🤗. One day, one who loved to party was sick but fortunately, I had somebody to study with and somebody to talk to.
                <br><br>
                That one best friend is Monolith. It's great to have such a relationship but if something goes wrong, it's terrible. My group of three friends is microservices - mitigating the risk around by making friends this way!
                <br><br>
                So, microservices architecture is always good?
                <br><br>
                No, having 3 friends may lead to more difficult communication and missing out on a deeper connection.
